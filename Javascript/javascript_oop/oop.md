## Object Prototype 

    Single copy having common properties such as functions
    & datatypes

## Factory Functions 

    functions that have data and methods.

```
     //Syntax 

    funtion myFunction(@param){
        //objects
        //methods
    }

    var x = myFunction(customParam);
```
# Drawbacks

- Creates new functions for each object creation
- Redundant

# Classes

``` 
    //Syntax
